I am a PhD candidate in crop breeding in genetics focusing on disease resistance in Tepary bean and participatory plant breeding. With my expertise in molecular genetics, I aim to help co-create culturally meaningful cultivars with diasporic communities. Together we can develop climate resilient, regionally adapted, and culturally relevant crops.

My interest is in connecting people to nature and improving community health as a result. Whether that's through community outreach, urban agriculture, conservation programs, or policy and communications work, my focus has stayed the same. I look forward to connecting with folks interested in building a healthier place.

I graduated from Kalamazoo College with a double major in Biology and Anthropology & Sociology. I obtained my Master's Degree in Plant Biology and Conservation and continuing into my first year as a PhD student. My academic career has been centered in understanding of plant-insect interactions, climate changes effects in communities (Los Angeles and the Philippines), and overall building a strong community among students of color!

My practical work focuses on the training of future Natural Areas stewards through Chicago Botanic Gardens SENA internship program. Our primary goal is to ensure more advanced training and professional development is accessible to those from historically disinvested communities and the entire BIPOC community. My research interests focus on habitat quality modeling within the urban landscape as a way to inform landscape design practices and land use planning.

I'm a restoration and conservation ecologist who has broad interests but probably am most often recognized as working on mixedwoods plains ecosystems (deciduous forest, prairies, alvars, dry and wet meadows, quarrying and other mining sites). I'm Editor-in-Chief of Restoration Ecology (the SER journal). I have a strong interest in translational ecology intersecting with restoration ecology as a path towards greater inclusion.

Michael Viramontes found his love of native plant restoration during his time at San Jose State University working on a B.S. in Environmental Studies. After working for 9 years in non-profit conservation and environmental education in both the SF bay area and southern California, Michael is now the Stewardship Manager at Rivers & Lands Conservancy (RLC) in Riverside, CA. Michael spends most of his time and energy at RLC figuring out how to protect and restore habitat for an endangered sandfly. In his free time, Michael helps organize the CNPS BIPOC Group.

I work in prescribed fire / habitat management, restoring and maintaining native ecosystems and supporting the species that call them home. I am a woodland critter living amongst the trees, my home in the forest is powered entirely by solar power, I live off-grid as sustainably and mindfully as I can and am motivated by civic responsibility as a citizen of the world. I love plants, animals, people, and prescribed fire and I am excited to be a part of this new community!
