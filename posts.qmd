As we celebrate Latine/Hispanic Heritage Month, it is a moment to honor the profound contributions of Latine communities to environmental justice, land stewardship, and social change. Today, we want to reflect on the legacy of Chico Mendes, a Brazilian labor leader, environmentalist, and conservationist who devoted his life to the protection of the Amazon Rainforest and the rights of the seringueiros, the rubber tree tappers of Acre.

Mendes understood the inextricable link between the well-being of the forest and the people whose livelihoods depend on it. He fought for land reform and sustainable practices in the face of destructive deforestation, all while advocating for the preservation of the Amazon, the "lungs of the planet." His work to protect the forest was not just about the environment but about human dignity, equity, and the rights of Indigenous and traditional peoples.

As we embark on our work with the Black Earth Restoration Collective, may we take inspiration from leaders like Chico Mendes who have paved the way for community-driven environmental activism. His vision reminds us of the power of collective action and the importance of preserving the Earth, not only for future generations but for those who call it home today. Let us honor his memory by deepening our commitment to restoring the Earth and protecting its most vulnerable communities.

In solidarity and restoration,
