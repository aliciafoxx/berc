    "text": "Honoring National Native American Heritage Month: Medicine Fish\nNovember 14, 2024\nDear Black Earth Restoration Collective,\nAs we enter into Native American Heritage Month, we want to celebrate and honor the heritage, history, and continuing vibrance of Native Americans in stewarding cultural and ecological connections with the Earth. As part of this celebration, we’d like to highlight the work of Medicine Fish, an incredible community-based non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the wellbeing and cultural connections of youth to the lands of the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin. Executive Director Bryant Waupoose grew up on the Menominee Reservation and confronted poverty, substance and other forms of abuse, and intergenerational trauma that colonialism wrought on the tribe. Through connecting with nature, Bryant found the spiritual and mental healing he sought and wanted to pass this on to the Menominee youth, which sparked him to found Medicine Fish.\nMedicine Fish has taken a unique approach to promoting youth wellness; they are helping the youth to re-establish their deep cultural connection with nature through camping, fly-fishing, and restoring the natural environment in their tribal lands. As part of their work, in 2022, Medicine Fish spearheaded the first reintroduction of bison to their ancestral lands since they were nearly driven to extinction in the late 1800s. The bison homecoming was facilitated by Medicine Fish youth, who built the fencing and prepared the land for the bison. The reintroduction of bison helped reinstate the lost cultural connection of the tribe to bison, who the Menominee consider an ancestor. More bison have been reintroduced since then, with the most recent reintroduction being just a few days ago.\n\nMedicine Fish hopes to restore prairie and wetland ecosystems and grow the bison herd as part of their ecological restoration goals, but more importantly, they continue to seek cultural restoration by encouraging youth to connect with the land, helping them to heal physically, emotionally, and spiritually. In doing so, Medicine Fish is making a huge difference in the lives of Menominee Youth, with the by-product being healthy, thriving, restored ecosystems. Medicine Fish’s work reminds us that restoration at its fullest potential goes well beyond restoring the ecology. It includes repairing and healing the intricate cultural connections between the people and the land.\nIn solidarity,\nEstablishing board Black Earth Restoration Collective\n\n\nHonoring Latine/Hispanic Heritage Month: Berta Cáceres\nDear Black Earth Restoration Collective,\n\nAs we celebrate Latine/Hispanic Heritage Month, it is a moment to honor the profound contributions of Latine community members to environmental justice, land stewardship, and social change. Not only is this month a time to reflect on heritage but also a call to recognize the contributions of those who have fought to protect our Earth, often at great personal cost. One such figure is Berta Cáceres (1971–2016), a Honduran environmentalist and indigenous rights activist whose work continues to inspire movements across the globe. As a co-founder of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), Cáceres courageously led her community in the fight to protect their land, water, and livelihoods from harmful development projects. Her advocacy for the Lenca people and the defense of the sacred Gualcarque River brought international attention to the struggles of indigenous communities resisting displacement and environmental degradation. Cáceres believed that the defense of the environment was inseparable from the fight for indigenous sovereignty and human rights.\nHer leadership not only protected vital ecosystems but also stood as a powerful testament to the deep connection between the earth and those who inhabit it. As we embark on our work with the Black Earth Restoration Collective, may we take inspiration from leaders like Berta Cáceres who have paved the way for community-driven environmental activism. Her vision reminds us of the power of collective action and the importance of preserving the Earth, not only for future generations but for those who call it home today. Let us honor her memory by deepening our commitment to restoring the Earth and protecting its most vulnerable communities.\nIn solidarity,\nEstablishing Board\nBlack Earth Restoration Collective"
