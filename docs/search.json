    "text": "Black Earth Restoration Collective (BERC) is a collective of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) working closely with plants.\n\nWe chose to include “Black” in the name to celebrate Blackness and Brownness, and to ensure our collective’s mission to celebrate and uphold BIPOC is clear. We use “Earth” to acknowledge our diverse connections to land. We chose to call this a collective because we aim to create a living, breathing community for BIPOC to engage, discuss, support, collaborate, celebrate, and offer opportunities to connect online and in-person.\n\nWe take a respectful approach to engagement and use transparency to the collective that maintains members’ agency by making collective decisions and discussions on (e.g., information usage and sharing, and collaboration.\n\nBERC welcomes white allies who will respectfully engage in community.\n\n\n\nOur Team\n\nDr. Nia Johnson (she/her)\nChicago Botanic Garden & Northwestern University\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am originally from Atlanta, Ga and earned my B.S. from Howard University. After teaching grade school science with Teach for America, I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology where my research focused on understanding the impacts of modern agricultural practices on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions and plant defense. Currently, as a Postdoctoral Researcher affiliated with the Synthesis Center for Conservation and Restoration (sCORE) at the Chicago Botanic Garden, I collaborate within interdisciplinary teams to carry out projects focused on plant restoration.

I am San Diego native and proud Filipino-American. At UCLA, I received a B.S. in Environmental Science and concentration in Environmental Health and with that research experiences that empowered and motivated me to address widespread ecological destruction.\nFor my PhD, I am working on our biodiversity-ecosystem function experiment which was established based on realistic combinations of plant species found at Nachusa Grasslands, a restored tallgrass prairie. For my dissertation, I aim to address 1) how do community changes in diversity (i.e., species richness and functional trait diversity) affect ecosystem function in a restored prairie ecosystem? (2) how does management of restored grasslands such as grazing influence ecosystem function?\n\n\n\nSarah Hollis (she/her)\nChicago Botanic Garden & Northwestern University\n\n\n Sarah is a Master’s student studying Plant Biology and Conservation at Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic Garden and a Research Assistant at the Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank.

Her honors thesis, Galápagos’ Blackberry Problem: A Novel Approach to Rubus niveus Management in the Galápagos Islands, examined the status of invasive species Rubus niveus in the Galápagos Islands and proposed support for local agricultural systems as a means of mitigating its impact.

    "text": "About BERC\n\nWe recognize that knowledge exists in many forms that has value in BIPOC communities and does not always conform to white and Western standards and practices.\nUltimately, the lack of collaboration and diversity in restoration practice, agricultural practice, and academics means valuable knowledge and skills are excluded and the needs of BIPOC community members aren’t considered or met.\nWe intend to cultivate this collective to center BIPOC perspectives, and to be a place for members to engage, discuss, support, and collaborate on topics in restoration and related topics (agriculture, plant-related research, sustainability, and ways these areas affect BIPOC communities).\nWe hope to build strong communities with members and facilitate collaborations\nWe share community rules of engagement below, woven around sweetgrass, and call on all members to engage respectfully and equitably. BERC is not a service to add a token BIPOC onto a team and give little autonomy or input. Members must be robustly and transparently engaged in collaborations and decisions."

This knowledge is often place-based and acquired collectively through generations via oral histories, artistry, and relationships. In order to work against the historic exclusion of BIPOC knowledge from academic spaces and restoration decision-making, we have crafted this working resource of published literature with the goal of making rich sources of knowledge from BIPOC communities more visible. We aim to actively cultivate this space to highlight the historic and ongoing contributions of BIPOC communities to the fields of land and resource stewardship and restoration.\nIf you would like to contribute a work that addresses BIPOC contribution to restoration knowledge and/or research works around the topic of BIPOC knowledge in restoration to the bibliography, please submit your work at this link."
